## Features
- Hyperparameter optimization with model development and evaluation
- Explainable AI customized for extracting SHAP values ([Lundberg & Lee, 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07874)) for interval validation data during repeated cross-validation:
  - Beeswarm plot for the most important features for one-year mortality prediction
  - Scatter plots with a LOESS curve and a 95% confidence interval
  - Clinically important reference values are highlighted on the LOESS curve when applicable
  - SHAP hazard ratios with 95% confidence interval showing the feature importance for a range of feature values
 
  The code for preprocessing the data is not available due to the sensitivity of the data.
